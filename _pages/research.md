# Research

My research work has two main application domains:

#### Smart Grids:
I have worked on data-driven detection of failures of transmission lines, including the study of cascading failures, and how can different agents cooperate to mitigate them through optimization-based control. I am currently working on:
- **NILM robustness**: we are studying how different data characteristics affect the performance of load disaggregation optimization programs.
- **Adversarial examples in transmission networks**: I am interested in studying how these types of examples affect systems that support power grid operations.

#### Data Networks:
I am interested in monitoring large scale networks using new data-driven paradigms such as model driven telemetry. I am currently working on:
- **Model driven Telemetry**: we are studying the effect of high resolution monitoring data has on data center network operations.
- **Data center management**: we are designing systems to support the operation of a local data center, including overloading alarms and energy modeling.

Also, currently I lead a campus-wide initiative called **PREC** where we aim to design a system that generates **P**ersonalized **R**ecommendations for **E**nergy **C**onsumption. This project includes several stages:
- *Monitoring*: we are designing tools to facility the interpretation of the energy consumption of 85 buildings.
- *Recommendations*: PREC will generate domain-expert rule-based recommendations along with RL-based automatic decisions. 
- *Follow-up*: users will interact to address energy consumption challenges and *vote* on effective actions to improve recommendations.

If you are interested in any of the ideas I am working on, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:jecordov@espol.edu.ec"> reach out.
