I am an Assistant Professor with the [Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FIEC)](http://www.fiec.espol.edu.ec/) at [ESPOL University](http://www.espol.edu.ec). I received a MSc (2012) and a PhD (2017) in Electrical Engineering from the [State University of New York at Stony Brook](http://www.stonybrook.edu) under the supervision of Xin Wang where I worked on data-driven monitoring and control of Smart Grids. I was the grantee of a Fulbright Scholarship during my masters studies. My research focuses in optimization and machine learning applications in Smart Grids and data networks.

At FIEC I currently serve as director for the Telematics Engineering Undergraduate program and the Professional Masters in Data Science. 

To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)).

We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Quantum Matter & Optics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home), as well as with the colleagues from our [world-class theory section](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl).

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**


We are grateful for funding from Leiden University, [NWO](www.nwo.nl) ([Vidi talent scheme](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme) and the [Frontiers in Nanoscience program](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/science/frontiers-of-nanoscience-nanofront)), and from an [ERC starting grant](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants).
